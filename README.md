Soil biogeochemical testbed 

Code Repository

Created by Will Wieder, Melannie Hartman, & Ben Sulman: 

Updated Aug. 29, 2018

Userâ€™s manual and technical documentation for the biogeochemical testbed accepted in Global Change Biology, Oct 2017.
The biogeochemical testbed code base used in these simulations is included (commit 26b4630).

Updates to the code base address issues documented here and include modifications to CORPSE parameterization and the addition of a soil moisture scalar to MIMICS. Updates to the Example_Grid also simulate RCP4.5 and 8.5 through 2100 for each model.
